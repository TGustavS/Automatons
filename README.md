# Automatons
Some Automatons I programmed.

# Pyramid
This is the first Automaton considered in 'A new kind of science'. Here each cell is either on or off depending on the states of the three cells above it. Interestingly one can get extremly complex behavoir even with such an simple premise. Below is a picture of Rule 30 creates such complex structures that its middle row was used as a random number generator in the mathematica programming language. The structure of it is still not understood.

# Langton's Ant
Check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant for a full explanation. In short there is an ant in the middle of the board that either moves left or right depending on the color of the tile it steps on. When a tile is stepped on it will change its color through a predetermined list of colors it can cycle through. <br>

I had some bugs while saving my results so here are some nice looking ones I was able to save. The rule is LLRR.

When trying out the program for yourself you will notice, that most of the rules will produce rather random looking things.
