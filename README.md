# Langton's Ant
Check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant for a full explanation. In short there is an ant in the middle of the board that either moves left or right depending on the color of the tile it steps on. When a tile is stepped on it will change its color through a predetermined list of colors it can cycle through. <br>

I had some bugs savong some of my results so here are some nice looking ones I was able to save:
